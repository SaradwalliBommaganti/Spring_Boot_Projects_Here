âœ… What is Tight Coupling?
Tight coupling means one class directly depends on another class. 
If one changes, the other will likely break or need modification too.

It violates the Open/Closed Principle and reduces flexibility and testability.

ðŸš« Problem:
If you want to switch to DieselEngine, you must edit the Car class.

Not flexible or scalable.
